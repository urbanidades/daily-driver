# Sync Workflow

1. **Read Orchestra**: Check `.agent/context/orchestra.md` to understand the current sprint goal and active streams.
2. **Read Memory**: Check `.agent/context/memory.md` for architectural decisions and tech stack details.
3. **Read Handoffs**: Check `.agent/context/handoffs.md` for any pending tasks assigned to you or open for claiming.
4. **Read Issues Log**: Check `ISSUES_LOG.md` for any known issues that might affect your work.
5. **Claim Work**: If you find a task, mark it as "In Progress" in the relevant documents.
